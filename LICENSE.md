### TIGRFAMs

The original TIGRFAMs database was a research project of the J. Craig
Venter Institute \(JCVI\) . TIGRFAMs, short for The Institute for
Genomic Research's database of protein families, is a collection of
manually curated protein families focusing primarily on prokaryotic
sequences. It consists of hidden Markov models \(HMMs\), multiple
sequence alignments, Gene Ontology \(GO\) terminology, Enzyme
Commission \(EC\) numbers, gene symbols, protein family names,
descriptive text, cross-references to related models in TIGRFAMs and
other databases, and pointers to the literature. The work has been
described in the articles listed in the References section above and
use of the TIGRFAMs database must grant proper attribution by citing
those four articles.
